Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the 
sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 8.

It would have to go through a sequence of 6 numbers to find 8 because you have to keep removing until you get to that desired 
number that is needed. 

Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify 
the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 16.

It would have to go through a sequence of 1 number because you will need to delete 18 and change 17 to 16.
