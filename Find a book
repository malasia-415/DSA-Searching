Imagine you are looking for a book in a library with a Dewey Decimal index. 
How would you go about it? Can you express this process as a search algorithm? Implement your algorithm to find 
a book whose Dewey and book title is provided.

I find it to be sumwhat like search algorithm because you have to find the book in a certain genre the find the book by letter
of theh last name of the author, then the books are in alphabetical order. So there are steps that are needed to be taken when 
finding a book in the libary.
